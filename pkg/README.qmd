# countreg: Count Data Regression in R

## Overview

The core of the `countreg` package consists of functions for a variety of count data
regression models:

* `nbreg()`: _Negative binomial regression_ (type 1 and 2), including both constant and
  varying dispersion parameters which can depend on regressors.
* `zeroinfl()` and `hurdle()`: _Zero-inflated and hurdle models_ for count data
  based on Poisson, geometric, negative binomial, and binomial distributions. These allow
  for excess zeros compared to the unadjusted underlying distributions (or also a deficit
  of zeros in case of the hurdle model).
* `zerotrunc()`: _Zero-truncated count regression_ based on Poisson, geometric, and
  negative binomial distributions. These models can be employed for the zero-truncated
  count part of hurdle models.
* `FLXMRnegbin()`: _Finite mixtures of negative binomial regressions_ via driver
  for the [flexmix](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=flexmix) package.
* `MBnegbin()`: _Model-based boosting of negative binomial regressions_ via driver
  for the [mboost](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mboost) package.

Previously available functions for _graphical goodness-of-fit assessment_ (rootograms,
PIT histograms, Q-Q plots based on randomized quantile residulas, etc.) are now provided
in the [topmodels](https://topmodels.R-Forge.R-project.org) package.

_Distribution functions_ (d/p/q/r) for the different zero-truncated, zero-inflated, and
hurdle count distributions are availabe in the
[distributions3](https://alexpghayes.github.io/distributions3/) package along with
corresponding distribution objects.


## Installation

The latest development version can be installed from R-universe:

``` r
install.packages("countreg", repos = "https://zeileis.R-universe.dev")
```

## Illustration

For demonstrating some of the available count regression models we analyze
the number of male satellites around nesting female horseshoe crabs during mating.
Because larger females that are in better condition tend to attract more satellites
we consider their carapace width and color as (numeric) regressor variables.
Package and data can be loaded and tranformed via:

```{r setup}
library("countreg")
data("CrabSatellites", package = "countreg")
cs <- CrabSatellites |>
  transform(color = as.numeric(color)) |>
  subset(select = c("satellites", "width", "color"))
```

The following four count models are compared: a Poisson generalized linear model
via `glm()`, a negative binomial regression with `nbreg()`,
a negative binomial hurdle model with `hurdle()`, and a zero-inflated negative
binomial model with `zeroinfl()`.

```{r models}
cs_p    <-      glm(satellites ~ ., data = cs, family = poisson)
cs_nb   <-    nbreg(satellites ~ ., data = cs)
cs_hnb  <-   hurdle(satellites ~ ., data = cs, dist = "negbin")
cs_zinb <- zeroinfl(satellites ~ ., data = cs, dist = "negbin")
```

The `glm()` function is from base R, all other models are from `countreg`.
All negative binomial models employ the type 2 parameterization. The
hurdle and zero-inflated models employ binary models for the zero hurdle
and zero-inflated part, respectively.

For a quick overview we compare the estimated coefficients from all
parts of the models and compute their BIC.

```{r comparison}
cbind(
  poisson = coef(cs_p),
  nb = coef(cs_nb, model = "mu"),
  hnb_count = coef(cs_hnb, model = "count"),
  hnb_zero = coef(cs_hnb, model = "zero"),
  zinb_count = coef(cs_zinb, model = "count"),
  zinb_zero = coef(cs_zinb, model = "zero")
)
BIC(cs_p, cs_nb, cs_hnb, cs_zinb)
```

This shows that

* The number of male satellites increase with `width` and
  decrease with `color` of the female carapace.
* The effect of the regressors mostly distinguishes between
  having any satellites or not while the expectation in the
  count part has almost no dependency on the regressors.
* There is overdispersion in the number of satellites because
  the negative binomial models fit much better than the simple
  Poisson model.
* There is only litte difference between the hurdle and zero-inflated
  model (except that the sign in the zero part is flipped because
  one models the probability to exceed zero while the other models
  the probability of an excess zero).

The summary of the hurdle negative binomial model provides
further details such as the non-significance of the regressors in
the count part and the estimate of the overdispersion parameter
`theta`.

```{r summary}
summary(cs_hnb)
```
