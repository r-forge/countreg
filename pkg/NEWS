Changes in Version 0.1-3

  o The hurdle() function now allows for the restriction of the theta
    parameter for the negative binomial distribution across the censored
    zero and truncated count components. The restriction is applied if
    dist = "negbin", zero.dist = "negbin", separate = FALSE.

  o Bug fix in the computation of the standard error of log(theta)
    in zeroinfl() when with weighted data. The weights were used
    for the estimation of log(theta) but the standard error was not
    scaled accordingly.


Changes in Version 0.1-2

  o The "style" and "scale" are now added as attributes to "rootogram"
    objects so that they can be re-used in the c() and + methods.


Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o New data sets SerumPotassium, TakeoverBids, VolcanoHeights.

  o New function disptest() providing several (score) tests for over/underdispersion.

  o New rootogram() function with a wide range methods for creating rootograms
    based on various fitted model objects (fitdistr, glm, hurdle, zeroinfl, zerotrunc â€¦)
  
  o FLXMRnegbin() driver for estimating mixtures of negative binomial models
    using flexmix.

  o MBnegbin(), MBztnegbin(), MBztpoisson() and MBbinomial() families for estimating 
    boosted components of hurdle models using mboost.


Changes in Version 0.1-0

  o Ported zeroinfl() and hurdle() along with corresponding vignette
    from "pscl" to "countreg".

  o Added zerotrunc() for estimating zero-truncated count regressions.
