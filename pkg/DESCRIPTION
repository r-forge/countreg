Title: Count Data Regression
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Achim", family = "Zeileis", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org"),
             person(given = "Christian", family = "Kleiber", role = "aut", email = "Christian.Kleiber@unibas.ch"))
Description: Regression models for count data, including zero-inflated,
             zero-truncated, and hurdle models as well as generalized count
             data regression. Drivers for combination with flexmix and mboost are
	     also provided. Furthermore, rootograms for assessing goodness of fit
	     for (regression) models are available.
LazyLoad: yes
Depends: R (>= 2.14.0), MASS
Suggests: AER, car, flexmix (>= 2.3-11), gamlss, gamlss.dist, ggplot2, lmtest, mboost, sandwich
