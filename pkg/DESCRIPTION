Description: Regression models for count data, including negative binomial, zero-inflated, zero-truncated,
             and hurdle models. Drivers for combination with flexmix and mboost are also provided.
             Previously available functions for graphical goodness-of-fit assessment (rootograms etc.)
             are now provided in the 'topmodels' package on R-Forge.
