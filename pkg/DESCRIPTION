Description: Regression models for count data, including zero-inflated, zero-truncated, and
             hurdle models as well as generalized count data regression. Drivers for combination
	     with flexmix and mboost are also provided. For (graphically) assessing the goodness
	     of fit for (regression) models, rootograms and quantile residuals are available.
